### DropProtect for Bukkit (1.7.2 to 1.7.4)

Don't want your players losing their entire inventory on death? **DropProtect protects** your **equipment** and **hotbar** slots, while allowing the inner inventory to drop as normal.

I find this to be the sweet spot between losing it all and having no penalty on death. Still penalize them for dying, but don't make them rage if they got a lag spike and fell into lava with their enchanted diamond set. Be nice to your players, people!
