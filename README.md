### DropProtect for Bukkit (1.7.2 and 1.7.4)

Don't want your players losing their entire inventory on death? **DropProtect protects** your **equipment** and **hotbar** slots, while allowing the inner inventory to drop as normal.

I find this to be the sweet spot between losing it all and having no penalty on death. Still penalize them for dying, but don't make them rage if they get a lag spike and fall into lava with their enchanted diamond set.

### Example

#### Inventory before and after death. Purple indicates protected slots:

#### And here's what remains at the crime scene for pick-up:

### Simple Drop-in Installation

Place the **DropProtect.jar** file into your **/server/plugins** folder. Start the server. You're done!

To make sure it's installed, put some items in your equipment slots, some in the hotbar, and some in the inner inventory. Then type /kill or find a more creative way to die. Your equipment (in the 4 equipment slots) and hotbar items should stay on you, while the remaining items will be on the ground where you died.

### Permissions

None. DropProtect will be enabled for all players in Survival mode.

### Commands and Configuration

None. I'm open to suggestions if you'd like to have more granular control over who is affected by DropProtect or how it works.
